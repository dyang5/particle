user_description: Iâ€™m a graduating senior from The College Preparatory School in Oakland, CA. In the fall, I will be attending Swarthmore College (hopefully in person)! As of now, I am planning to pursue Math and Computer Science, and am also interested in Economics as well. This website was made for personal experimentation purposes, please contact me if you have any questions at all.
